Best read in something better than notepad :) (notepad++)

Assembly:
	Labels:
		When referring to labels always put a : before the label name
		Declare labels by ending the name with a :
	Registers:
		Registers can have the following prefixes: %, $
	Values:
		Hexadecimal values have to have one of the following prefixes: $, 0x
		Decimal values should not have a prefix
	Branches:
		Unconditional branches (b, bl) will take a straight address or a label
			b 0x002400C8, bl :loc_2400C8
		Conditional branches (beq, bne) will take an offset (from the current address) or a label
			beq cr4, 0x18, bne :loc_18
	Commands:
		Be sure to treat setreg as 2 lines of code. As it gets assembled as "lis ?, 0xHI16" "ori ?, ?, 0xLO16"
		Both hook and hookl can only be called once. They should also be called before address is called
		Both hook and hookl shouldn't be used unless you only use one hook. Otherwise it is much more reliable to use a b or bl instead
	
Disassembly:
	Format:
		The format MUST be in NetCheat PS3 format. If it is in another format use the Conversion tool in the Tools menu
		Anything that isn't disassembled will appear as hexcode 0xZZZZZZZZ
	Output:
		All branches will branch to labels
		ori r0, r0, 0 will be disassembled as nop
		
Short-cuts:
	Assembly RTB:
		Ctrl L:			Color everything in the RTB
		Ctrl Z:			Redo (Use Ctrl-L after it to color everything)
		Drag and Drop:	You can drag a file on the the assembly RTB to open it
	Form:
		Ctrl O:			Open file
		Ctrl S:			Save file
		Ctrl Shift S:	Save file as
		F5:				Assemble
		F6:				Disassemble
		F7:				Emulate
	Emulator:
		F11:			Step Into
		F10:			Step Over
	Pseudo Instructions:
		Delete (DEL):	Delete the pseudo instruction entirely
		DblClick list	Adds another blank pseudo instruction
