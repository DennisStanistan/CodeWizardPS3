========
CodeWizard PS3 has been developed by Dnawrkshp using the Visual C# 2012 Express Edition IDE.

The reason I made this is because I noticed that you needed to write PPC Assembly directly in hex instead of assembly.
Since I am so used to using tools like PS2Dis and CodeDesigner to make subroutines (PS2), I chose to make something similar.
I did my best to make an assembler/disassembler that was easy to add to and wasn't hard to understand.
Though some of my methods are wonky, most of it works fairly well and accurately.
So here are a collection of videos I made to help understand the source code of CodeWizard: 

There aren't many supported instructions, but if anyone would like to add some feel free to.
Just contact me in some way and/or commit your version to some repository.
I can then implement it into the official version (if it hasn't already been done).

The version number (#a.#b.#c.#d) is read like so:
	#a: Application version
	#b: Assembler version
	#c: Disassembler version
	#d: Emulator version
Kind of messy so I will probably just change how that is read in the future...


If you encounter any bugs, have ideas, or simply want to say thanks, please reply to the thread I made on ps3hax.net

Hope this is helpful and enjoy!

P.S. If you ever make a package include the following:
	this README
	Help.txt
	Pseudo Instructions folder and its contents
	CodeWizardPS3.exe
	Anything else that is relevant to CodeWizard (I included some examples)
